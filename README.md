# SqlProject
SQL data exploration Covid-19

*Project Summary*

1Created a database to store and analyze COVID-19 data, including cases, deaths, and vaccinations, using SQL.

2.Analyzed data to identify trends, such as countries with the highest infection rates and death counts per population, 
  and calculated metrics such as death percentage and cases per population.

3.Used common table expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables to streamline queries and improve performance.
  Presented findings in clear and visually appealing charts and graphs.




*Some of the key insights from the queries include:*

1.India had a relatively high death percentage compared to other countries, at around 1.3%.

2.India also had a high number of total cases compared to its population, with around 2.5% of the population having contracted the virus.

3.Some countries had very high infection rates compared to their populations, with cases per population ranging from around 7% to 20%.

4.The global death percentage was around 2%, with some countries having much higher rates.

5.Vaccination data was also analyzed, with one query calculating the total number of vaccinations administered over time for each country.

Overall, the project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, with a focus on understanding the impact of the virus on different countries and populations. The use of SQL queries to explore the data allows for efficient and targeted analysis of specific aspects of the data.
